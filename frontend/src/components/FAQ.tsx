    question: "What exactly is AgentGrid?",
    answer: "AgentGrid is an AI-powered operating system that acts as your virtual C-suite. You simply input a high-level business goal, and our ecosystem of specialized AI agents (Marketing, Finance, Hiring, etc.) collaborate to break it down, plan, and execute the work autonomously."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I lose control over my business decisions?",
    answer: "Not at all. AgentGrid includes a robust Human-in-the-Loop system. While the agents can execute routine tasks autonomously, any high-stakes decisions, contract approvals, or significant budget allocations are always flagged for your final review and authorization."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to integrate with my existing tools?",
    answer: "Our platform is designed to be plug-and-play. AgentGrid natively integrates with most major CRMs, ad networks, and project management tools in minutes, allowing your AI agents to start working immediately without complex migrations."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the AI agents make a mistake?",
    answer: "The system is built with cross-agent validation. For example, before the Marketing Agent launches a campaign, the Legal Agent checks the copy for compliance risks, and the Finance Agent verifies the budget. This multi-layered validation drastically reduces the margin of error."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my company's data safe and private?",
    answer: "Security is our top priority. All data processed by AgentGrid is enterprise-grade encrypted. We use isolated instances for each client, meaning your proprietary business data is never shared or used to train public AI models."
